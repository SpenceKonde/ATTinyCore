# Supported IDE versions

ATtinyCore (Universal) works with all versions of the official IDE (from arduino.cc ) from version 1.6.3 onwards. For boards manager installation, 1.6.4 or later is required. Due to serious bugs, 1.6.6, 1.6.7, 1.6.8, and 1.6.10 are not recommended. Version 1.8.9 is recommended.

## Boards Manager Installation

This core can be installed using the boards manager. The boards manager URL is:

`http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json`

1. File->Preferences on a PC, or Arduino->Preferences on a Mac, enter the above URL in "Additional Boards Manager URLs
2. Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager...
  *If using 1.6.6, close boards manager and re-open it (see below)
3. Select "ATTinyCore by Spence Konde" and click "Install".

Due to [a bug](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/3795) in 1.6.6 of the Arduino IDE, new boards manager entries are not visible the first time Boards Manager is opened after adding a new boards manager URL. If you are still using this version of the IDE, you should update. It is ancient.

## Manual Installation

Option 1: Download the .zip, extract, and place in the hardware folder inside your sketchbook folder (if there is no hardware folder, create it). You can find/set the location of the sketchbook folder in the Arduino IDE at File > Preferences -> Sketchbook location.

Option 2: Download the github client, and sync this repo to the hardware subfolder of your sketchbook folder.
