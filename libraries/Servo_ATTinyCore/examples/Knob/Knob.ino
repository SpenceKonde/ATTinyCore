 If Servo library is installed to libraries, then that version (which doesn't support ATTiny parts)
 will be used instead of the one included with the core, which does. To get around this,
 include  Servo_ATTinyCore.h instead - this will always use the version that came with core.

#include <Servo_ATTinyCore.h>

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo

int potpin = 0;  // analog pin used to connect the potentiometer
int val;    // variable to read the value from the analog pin

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
  val = analogRead(potpin);            // reads the value of the potentiometer (value between 0 and 1023)
  val = map(val, 0, 1023, 0, 180);     // scale it to use it with the servo (value between 0 and 180)
  myservo.write(val);                  // sets the servo position according to the scaled value
  delay(15);                           // waits for the servo to get there
}
