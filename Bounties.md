### Policies w/regards to bounties for priority PRs

In recognition of the large number of issues that need to be fixed here, and of the fact that I've got a pile of inventory for my Tindie store, I've decided to begin offering bounties on priority issues. For now, this will be limited to documentation issues. If it works out I may expand it to code as well.

### Available "Bounties" will be listed in Issues.
These will list the requirements for successfully claiming the bounty. The value of the bounty will be listed in the title of the issue. These requirements will be quite specific, as the whole point is for me to avoid having to do extensive editing before merging the PR.

### All bounties will be in the form of free stuff from my Tindie store.
Free shipping via USPS first class mail is included for domestic bounty claimants. Due to the higher cost of international shipping, $2 will be debited from the value of the bounty if shipping internationally.

### If you have any questions about the requirements, email me before you start working
That way you can save yourself time and trouble, and it will save me the awkward conversation if a submitted "bounty" PR ends up not meeting the requirements for inclusion in core. My email address is spencekonde@gmail.com
