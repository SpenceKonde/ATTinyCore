/*--------------------------------------------------------------------
  This file is part of the tinyNeoPixel library, derived from
  Adafruit_NeoPixel. Modification was carried out between 2016 and
  2021 by Spence Konde for ATTinyCore, and later megaTinyCore and
  DxCore. The latest modification eliminates the menu for the port -
  It uses ST instructions now, and while the assembly is uglier, the
  result is often smaller code that doesn't need a stupid menu option.

  This is the "static allocation" version of this library. You must
  pass a pointer to a suitable array to use as the frame buffer, and
  you must ensure that the pin being used is set output. We don't do
  that here, so that you can use direct port writes to set it output
  while using less flash.

#include <Arduino.h>

// The order of primary colors in the NeoPixel data stream can vary
// among device types, manufacturers and even different revisions of
// the same item.  The third parameter to the Adafruit_NeoPixel
// constructor encodes the per-pixel byte offsets of the red, green
// and blue primaries (plus white, if present) in the data stream --
// the following #defines provide an easier-to-use named version for
// each permutation.  e.g. NEO_GRB indicates a NeoPixel-compatible
// device expecting three bytes per pixel, with the first byte
// containing the green value, second containing red and third
// containing blue.  The in-memory representation of a chain of
// NeoPixels is the same as the data-stream order; no re-ordering of
// bytes is required when issuing data to the chain.

// Bits 5,4 of this value are the offset (0-3) from the first byte of
// a pixel to the location of the red color byte.  Bits 3,2 are the
// green offset and 1,0 are the blue offset.  If it is an RGBW-type
// device (supporting a white primary in addition to R,G,B), bits 7,6
// are the offset to the white byte...otherwise, bits 7,6 are set to
// the same value as 5,4 (red) to indicate an RGB (not RGBW) device.
// i.e. binary representation:
// 0bWWRRGGBB for RGBW devices
// 0bRRRRGGBB for RGB

// RGB NeoPixel permutations; white and red offsets are always same
